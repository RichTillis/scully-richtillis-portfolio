    <div class="about-right">
      <p>I've been developing software and enhancing operations across enterprises for over 14 years. I
        design systems that align end-user needs with long-term solutions to real-world problems. I have a
        successful track record of creating exceptional web-based software.
      </p>
      <p>Ok, ok ... humbly stepping down from my elevator-pitch soapbox... I'm just a developer who really enjoys learning and
        loves creating solutions that address interesting and complex challenges.</p>
